Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?

## Motivation: why are you working on this project?
We commit to contributing these two values to users.
1)Personal growth
- Playing alone enables players to progress at their own pace, pursuing personal growth and a sense of achievement. It promotes their personal introspection, discipline, and strategic thinking.
2)Joy of exploration and discovery
- Our game is world exploration and puzzle-solving. It offers players the joy of discovery and the freedom to explore.


## Risks to project completion:

- Little experience with frontend languages
- Lack of upfront resources
- No prior experience working together as a team
- No prior experience working on a distributed project

## Mitigation Strategy for above risks:

- Utilize weekly meetings to discuss and assist each other
- Re-assess workload during weekly meetings
